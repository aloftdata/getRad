# VPTS file coverage

Various sources of VPTS files cover different radars and time periods.
Here we visualize the temporal coverage per source and radar. If you
click on a radar on the map a plot shows the percentage of days with
available data per month. Note that this article gets generated
irregularly and is up to date until 2025-12-03.

For a more detailed description of the data in Aloft bucket and its
