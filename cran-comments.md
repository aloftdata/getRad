We would like to contribute the package `getRad` to CRAN. The package facilitates data access to radar data for aero ecology. 

As it is a first release reverse dependencies are not an issue. Furthermore the package passes the cran tests,

Note the package checks identify "aeroecological" as a misspelled word, however aeroecology is a discipline of ecology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroecology).
